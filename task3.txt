From the above tables, In both the graphs G1 and G2 we see that only 2 of the top 5 pages obtained by 
counting the number of in-links match the list of top 5 pages obtained by calculating the pagerank.

This is because the PageRank for a page depends on the PageRank of all the pages that are pointing to it.
In our case, the page "Efficient_energy_use" has 286 pages pointing to it but when the same page was 
passed through the page rank algorithm, it didn't even make the top 5. This is because the pages that are 
pointing to this page don't have a good pagerank value. 

The page "WT25-B39-116" in G2 is at the 3rd position when ranked according to the pagerank values, 
but it doesn't occur anywhere near the top 5 when checked for the number of inlinks it has. 
The reason is that though the page may contain less number of inlinks, it has popular/quality links 
pointing to it, that is , the pagerank of the links are high or good. 
On the other hand a page may have very large inlink count, but all these inlinks may not be popular and
thus will be low pagerank scores.

The dependencies while calculating pagerank can be shown as :

A -> B C
B -> C
C -> A

From the above example, to calculate the pagerank of C we need the pageranks of both A and B as both these pages 
are pointing to C. Same way to calculate the pagerank of A its necessary to have the pagerank of c, and to calculate
for B we need A. Thus if pageranks of the inlinks are good, the pagerank of source will by obvious be good.

It wouldn't be wrong to say that the pagerank of a page is directly proportional to that of its in-links.
And this why ranks of the same page may vary when ranked according to pagerank and by the number of in-links.
